Given an array of integers, find if the array contains any duplicates.

Your function should return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and it should return false if every element is distinct.

Example: [1,1], should return true because it contains duplicates.
Example: [1,2], should return false because it doesn't contain duplicates
